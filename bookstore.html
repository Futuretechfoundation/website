To integrate the NOWPayments button into the HTML code, you can replace the current Bitcoin payment button with the code you provided. Here's how you can update the payment section of the HTML to include the NOWPayments button:

### Updated HTML Code with NOWPayments Button:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Surgical Robots: Revolutionizing the Future</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- Link to your CSS file if applicable -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Header -->
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to Our Bookstore</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <!-- Book Details Section -->
    <section id="book-details">
        <h2>Surgical Robots: Revolutionizing the Future</h2>
        <img src="surgical-robots-cover.jpg" alt="Surgical Robots Book Cover" id="book-cover">
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> 0.01 BTC</p> <!-- Example price in Bitcoin -->

        <div class="book-description">
            <h3>About the Book</h3>

        </div>

        <!-- Bitcoin Payment Button (NOWPayments) -->
        <div id="bitcoin-payment">
            <h3>Buy the Book with Bitcoin</h3>
            <p>Click the button below to purchase the book and receive an immediate download link after payment.</p>
            
            <!-- NOWPayments Payment Button -->
            <a href="https://nowpayments.io/payment/?iid=4582998425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                <img src="https://nowpayments.io/images/embeds/payment-button-black.svg" alt="Crypto payment button by NOWPayments">
            </a>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Footer -->
    <footer>

    </footer>

</body>
</html>
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Payment Button**: The `<a>` tag with the NOWPayments link is now embedded directly into the payment section.
2. **Image**: The NOWPayments button image (`<img>`) is included inside the anchor (`<a>`) tag to display the payment button.

When a user clicks the payment button, it will open the NOWPayments checkout page in a new tab for them to complete the Bitcoin payment.
