            <h2>Space Exploration and Missions</h2>
            <p>
                Humanity's return to the Moon is led by NASA’s Artemis program, aiming to establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. 
                Artemis I was an uncrewed test of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft, while Artemis II will send humans around the Moon, 
                culminating in a lunar landing with Artemis III. Advances in lunar landers, such as SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon, are critical for enabling these missions.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Mars, the Perseverance rover continues its exploration, searching for signs of ancient microbial life and preparing for future human missions. 
                It operates alongside the Ingenuity helicopter, the first aircraft to fly on another planet, demonstrating the potential of aerial vehicles in planetary exploration.
                Meanwhile, the Mars Sample Return mission, a collaboration between NASA and ESA, is under development to retrieve rock samples for analysis on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond our planetary neighbors, space probes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmos. 
                JWST has already provided unprecedented views of distant galaxies and insights into the atmospheres of exoplanets. The upcoming Europa Clipper mission will explore Jupiter’s icy moon, 
                Europa, for potential signs of life beneath its frozen crust.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asteroid mining represents a new frontier in space exploration. Companies like Planetary Resources aim to harvest materials from asteroids, including water for fuel and rare metals for industrial use. 
                Missions such as NASA’s OSIRIS-REx, which collected samples from asteroid Bennu, demonstrate the feasibility of these efforts, though the economic and technological challenges remain significant.

        <section id="section-2">
            <h2>Spacecraft Design and Propulsion</h2>
            <p>
                The advent of reusable rockets has revolutionized space travel, significantly reducing launch costs. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Starship, along with Blue Origin’s New Shepard, are leading the charge. 
                These technologies enable frequent launches, making space more accessible for scientific, commercial, and human exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In propulsion, electric systems like ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters are proving critical for long-duration missions. These systems, such as those used on the Dawn spacecraft, offer high efficiency for interplanetary travel. 
                Nuclear propulsion, including nuclear thermal and nuclear electric propulsion (NTP and NEP), holds promise for faster travel to Mars and beyond. Research into fusion propulsion and concepts like antimatter engines may one day enable interstellar probes, such as Breakthrough Starshot, which aims to reach Alpha Centauri using laser-powered light sails.

        <section id="section-3">
            <h2>Satellite Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Satellites play an essential role in modern life, from communications to Earth observation. CubeSats, small modular satellites, have revolutionized research and technology testing, offering cost-effective access to space. 
                Networks like Starlink and OneWeb aim to provide global internet coverage, transforming connectivity in remote areas while raising concerns about space debris and orbital crowding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earth observation satellites, such as those in NASA’s Earth Observing System, monitor climate change, track natural disasters, and aid in resource management. 
                On-orbit servicing technologies are being developed to extend the lifespan of satellites, enabling repair and refueling missions, as demonstrated by the MEV-1 mission.

        <section id="section-4">
            <h2>Space Habitats and Life Support</h2>
            <p>
                Space stations are evolving with the planned retirement of the ISS and the development of commercial alternatives by companies like Axiom Space. 
                Future habitats on the Moon and Mars will rely on in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), using local materials for construction and producing oxygen and water from the environment. 
                Advances in radiation protection, such as hydrogen-rich plastics and regolith shielding, are critical for ensuring astronaut safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life support systems are also advancing, with technologies for recycling air, water, and waste being tested aboard the ISS. Future systems must support long-duration missions, 
                including the cultivation of crops in controlled environments to sustain crews on Mars or during interplanetary travel.

        <section id="section-5">
            <h2>Advanced Research and Space Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                Emerging technologies like 3D printing in microgravity are transforming space manufacturing. Tools, components, and even food are being printed aboard the ISS, reducing dependence on Earth resupply. 
                Concepts for space factories involve producing pharmaceuticals and high-quality materials in orbit, leveraging microgravity for innovations not possible on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artificial gravity, a critical concept for long-duration missions, is being explored through designs like rotating habitats. Advances in physics, including dark matter detection and the study of dark energy, 
                rely on observatories like JWST and future missions. Exoplanet detection techniques, including transit photometry and direct imaging, are refining the search for habitable worlds, bringing us closer to discovering extraterrestrial life.
