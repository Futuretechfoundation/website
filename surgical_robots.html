            <h2>Introduction to Surgical Robotics</h2>
            <p>
                Surgical robotics integrates advanced robotic systems into surgical practices to enhance precision, control, and visualization. The field gained momentum in the 1990s with the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System, which transformed minimally invasive procedures by offering surgeons improved dexterity and high-definition 3D imaging. Robotic systems aim to overcome traditional surgical limitations, offering benefits like reduced tremors, smaller incisions, and faster patient recovery times.

            <h2>Robotic Surgical Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Robotic surgical systems are categorized into three types: master-slave systems like da Vinci, supervisory-controlled systems like RAVEN, and collaborative robots designed to work with surgeons. These systems consist of robotic arms, high-definition imaging, master consoles, and motion tracking, enabling precise control.
                <br><br>
                Integration with surgical navigation systems enhances outcomes in complex procedures like neurosurgery. Advanced imaging and augmented reality are being incorporated into these systems, further improving precision. Despite their benefits, challenges like cost, training, and system limitations remain critical considerations.
