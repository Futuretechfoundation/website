        <figcaption>Future Tech Foundation's first badge toward e-NABLE Community Chapter membership.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        This badge represents their commitment to the mission of empowering individuals and communities by creating innovative, 3D-printed prosthetic devices for those in need.
    </p>
    <h3>What is e-NABLE?</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>e-NABLE</strong> community is a global network of volunteers dedicated to providing free and affordable assistive devices using 3D printing technology. Since its inception, e-NABLE has connected makers, engineers, educators, and enthusiasts to work together on creating prosthetic hands and arms for individuals who have lost limbs or were born without them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This community's open-source designs, collaborative spirit, and focus on accessibility have transformed lives worldwide, enabling recipients to regain independence and functionality at a fraction of the cost of traditional prosthetics.
    </p>
    <p>
        By earning their first badge, the Future Tech Foundation is on its way to joining the ranks of active e-NABLE chapters, further advancing this inspiring mission.
